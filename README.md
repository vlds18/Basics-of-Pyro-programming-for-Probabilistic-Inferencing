# Basics of Pyro Programming

This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic programming using Pyro, a flexible probabilistic programming language built on PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This tutorial covers fundamental concepts from basic probabilistic models to Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling, demonstrating how to:

- Define probabilistic models in Pyro
- Perform Bayesian inference using MCMC with NUTS sampling
- Handle conditional models and observational data
- Work with multi-dimensional distributions and plates
- Visualize posterior distributions
